        <h2>Initial Inspiration</h2>
        <img src="../images/stardew.jpeg" alt="Pixel art drawing of farm scene from the video game Stardew Valley. Says title Stardew Valley above drawing.">
        <p>For me, the inspiration from video games began when I was a little girl. I had an older 
            brother who used to play a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) with me. I 
            used to draw the maps, draw the characters, and we'd play hours a day using our imagination. 
            Over time my brother started playing video games with his friends. He invited me over one day to 
            his friend's house since my parents didn't allow video games at ours yet. Playing on the flatscreen TV
            was The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. 
            Before that time I had never seen anything like it. It was just like my imagination but all come to life. 
            The magic, the quests, the nature, the creativity! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now this is just the first taste I had of video games and how they could bring ideas to life in a 
            very immersive manner.
        </p>
        <p>Fast forward many years, I read an article on the game recently released called 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley">Stardew Valley</a>. 
            this artitcle talked about how one person going by the title of Concerned Ape made the entire game on his own. 
            He made the art, animation, UI, music, even the graphic engine environment in which he coded. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That's when it hit me, <i>why not me?</i> So ever since the combination of initial intrigue to the realization that 
            you can indeed make your own game, I became interested in Indie Game Dev. I've also discovered the large 
            communities online of people working on similar porjects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I am working on a game inspired by Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. It is a 2D pixelart farming sim with
            more elements of magic and exploring that the previous games mentioned.

        <h2>Game Dev Partner</h2>
        <img src="../images/chris.png" alt="Pixel art drawing of Chris Davidoff. Man with brown hair and black shirt.">
        <p>My game dev partner Chris Davidoff is a close friend of mine from Boulder. We met during our
            undergraduate degrees at University of Colorado, Boulder. Chris got a degree in Computer Science
            while I got mine in Media Proudction & Design. Chris and I initially met with ideas to work together
            to make projects like interactive sculptures, however as time passed we noticed our mutual enjoyment and 
            enthusiasm for video games. With my visual design skills and his programming skills we realized the 
            opprotunity for partnership on a project like Indie Game Development. For Redstone Hollows Chris 
            handles all the work in Unity, (if you want to learn more about Unity <a href="./programs.html">click here</a>) 
            while I focus on the visual assets like art, animation, UX & UI design, ect.
