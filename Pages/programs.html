        <h2>Visual Assets</h2>

        <p>The main program I use for the visual assets is <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/"><b>Aseprite</b></a>. Since the game I am currenty
            working on is 2D pixel art, it made sense to use a program specifically designed for that type 
            of work. Aseprite is better than programs like Adobe Photoshop because it has abilities to better 
            plug into functions with Unity (our chosen graphics engine). Plus Adobe Photoshop is a a bit of 
            overkill when you just want to work with such small resolution files. Another great aspect of Aseprite is that 
            it has lots of support for key frame animation including tools like onion skins (seeing the frame before and/or after
            the current frame you're working on). 
        </p>
        <p>
            So far Aseprite has been a wonderful tool to work with and there are many creators on the internet That
            have tutorials and references to learn from. It's easy to join communities and forums for pixel art as well!

        <img src="../images/illustrator.png" alt="logo of vector graphics program Adobe Illustrator.">
        <p>For the UI I am currently using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html"><b>Adobe Illustrator</b></a>. Perhaps it initially stems from the fact that I got my 
            bachelors in Graphic Design so I feel fairly comfortable using this program. Another big reason I chose to use Illustrator
            for now is that the vector graphics allows me to scale and change assets quickly so my game dev partner can more effectively 
            make changes in Unity. The flexibility and effeciency of time Illustrator creates is important this early on in the game 
            making process because <i>soo</i> much can (and will) change in the UI over time. There is a chance we may decide to make the 
            UI pixel art as well but for now it's easier to make quick mockups and placeholders using vector graphics.

    <div id="Graphics Engine">
        <h2>Graphics Engine & Coding</h2>

        <img src="../images/unity.png" alt="logo of graphics engine program Unity.">
        <p>For the graphics engine <a href="how_it_began.html">Chris</a> (my game dev partner) and I decided to go with 
        <a href="https://unity.com/"><b>Unity</b></a>. A game engine or graphics engine is a software framework 
        primarily designed for the development of video games and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs. 
        Another popular one you may have heard of is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine</a>. Most indie
        game developers I have met use one of these two. Technically it is possible to create your own but that that point you're
        "re-inventing the wheel" and realistically you may never get to the actual creation of your game. Creating a framework is 
        it's own development niche. That all being said, one of the reasons we chose Unity over Unreal is that Unreal is wonderful 
        for 3D games. It has more support in that realm but we wanted to use an engine that better supports 2D assets. Another reason 
        is that the coding language for Unity is C# and overall supports coding freedom over graphical support that Unreal has. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It's one of those things where each has their strengths and weaknesses depending on what you're looking to work on.
