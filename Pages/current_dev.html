        <p>Redstone Hollows is curently only in it's very initial development. Not only are Chris and I new to game Devb
            but both of us work fulltime, me as a Barista and Chris as a Software Engineer. Additionally I just recently relocated
            from the US to the Netherlands and sometime this year Chris intends to move from Colorado to Prague. Despite all of that 
            we intend to re-start our development on it. It would be wonderful if by early next year we have a 
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter </a>for our project to help fund us. We intent to release this game 
            to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/">Steam</a> as some point. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Redstone Hollows is going to be a co-op game. Chris has already begun coding with that in mind and the functionality already 
            coming to fruition. So if you were hoping to play with friends we've got you covered!

        <h2><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/juniperfawn"><b>Twitch</b></a></h2>
        <p>I used to stream consistently but hopefully soon I will get back to streaming game dev content on Twitch.
            I mainly stream me drawing on Aseprite while chatting with viewers. It's a wonderful way for me to get 
            live feedback if I ask and to meet other people with similar interests. Many times it is other game developers
            who join in on the chats. I also stream other people's indie games to see what other small groups/people are capable of. 
            It's a great way to support other people while also gaining inspiration for myself.

        <h2><a href="https://twitter.com/JuniperFawnn"><b>Twitter</b></a></h2>
        <p>
            On Twitter I post little snippets of drawings and updates on content. I also re-tweet art and games I find inspiring. 
            Sometimes I even re-wteet "how to" content - so tutorials that range from pixel art to 3D modeling.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ceracontesse4191"><b>Youtube</b></a></h2>
        <p>
            Youtube a space that I do more vlog like content. That means it ranges from all aspects of my life. I am also very 
            into traveling and photography so you can see content of a wider range here. Most "game dev" related content is found
            through Twitch and Twitter for now. I do plan to eventually post some here but more in the future.
